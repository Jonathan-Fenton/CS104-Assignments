        One form of religious painting in Japan was the creation of pilgrimage mandalas, which were large hanging scroll paintings that showed a trail to a sacred religious site. They were widely believed to have been made to inspire religious citizens and pilgrims to donate to religious institutions. One of the largest and most detailed of the mandalas was “Pilgrimage Mandala of Nachi Shrine,” showing a trail to the sacred Nachi Waterfalls. Currently residing in The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, this mandala demonstrates beautiful artistic representations of landscape and religious sites. While this painted scroll had the main purpose of appealing to the charity of religious citizens, I will argue that its ability to illustrate various sacred sites allows it to demonstrate religious architecture’s significance in the spiritual life of the Japanese in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
